                <h3>What is Health Insurance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Health Insurance is a product by Insurance Companies to cover the medical and surgical expenses
                        <br>
                        incurred by the insurer. Health is the most unpredictable aspect of one's life. Anybody <br>
                        can encounter a serious health issue at any stage of life. Health problems need not crop up only
                        in old age.
                    </li>

                    <li>If not any health issue, it could be hospitalisation due to an accident. Meeting medical
                        expenses which appear out-of-the-blue is not in the reach of everyone. At least not at present
                        times, when the cost of medical treatment is soaring high day by day.

                    </li>
                    <li>The product that covers the expenses that arise out of such emergencies is Health Insurance.
                        Periodical payment of premium as stipulated by the Insurance Company has to be made. The payment
                        of the premium could be either monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly.</li>
                    <li>The insurance company either pays the medical expenses incurred directly to the hospital or will
                        reimburse the expenses to the insured individual. Flexible coverage for ailments/disease is
                        provided. Some Health Insurance companies offer a cover for as many as 80 and above surgical
                        procedures and as many as 30 and above critical illness.</li>
                    <li>Health Insurance can be a saviour when such critical emergencies emerge at the eleventh hour. If
                        you have a huge family responsibility with regard to every member of the family, then going in
                        for Health Insurance for the entire family is recommended.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="box">
                <ul>
                    <li>With a Health Insurance Policy, you will be able to get medical treatment in the best of
                        hospitals without being worried about the cost of the treatment.</li> <br>
                    <li>Any medical emergencies can be handled with great ease even at times when you are in a
                        disastrous financial situation.</li><br>
                    <li>Imagine you come across a situation when you are diagnosed with a health issue which can be
                        treated in specialised hospitals whose cost of medical treatment seems unaffordable. This is at
                        such times that Health Insurance comes handy.</li><br>
                    <li>The cashless facility of the Health Insurance policy is the best feature. All the expenses
                        incurred in the course of your medical treatment will be directly remitted to the hospital and
                        you will not have to worry about paying the hospital first and then claiming reimbursement from
                        the Insurance Company.</li><br>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <h4>The main features of a Health Insurance policy are:</h4>
                    <li>Cover for expenses incurred prior to hospitalisation and post hospitalisation
                        The expenses incurred 30 to 60 days prior to hospitalisation and post hospitalisation will be
                        reimbursed upon submission of relevant bills and receipts.</li> <br>
                    <b>Treatment without payment - Cashless treatment:</b> <br>

                    Under this feature, treatment will be provided in the hospitals listed in the insurance policy
                    without the payment of cash. This relieves you of the burden of arranging for cash to meet the
                    expenses. The hospital authorities will send a pre-authorisation request with the details of
                    treatment and the cost. Pre-authorisation from the company will be as good as paying cash for the
                    treatment. The insurance company will remit the treatment expenses directly to the hospital.</b>

            <div class="box">
                <h4 style="margin-left: 3rem;">Claim Ratio and Claim Settlement Ratio in India</h4> <br>
                <p style="margin-left:3rem">The claim ratio is nothing but the claims settled versus the premium
                    collected. If the claim settled is <br>
                    95% then the Company would have settled claims up to 95% of the premium collected and 5% <br>
                    would be the profit for the Company. The higher the claim ratio the lesser will be the profit earned
                    <br>
                    by the Company. If the claim ratio crosses 100%, it means that the Company may be providing <br>
                    funds for claim settlement out of their reserves which is not good for the Company. The higher <br>
                    claim ratio is good for the customers since it indicates that the company is successfully meeting
                    the claims made.
