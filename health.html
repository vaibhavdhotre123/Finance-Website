                <h3>What is Health Health Insurance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Health Health Insurance is a product by Health Insurance Companies to cover the medical and
                        surgical expenses
                        <br>
                        incurred by the insurer. Health is the most unpredictable aspect of one's life. Anybody <br>
                        can encounter a serious health issue at any stage of life. Health problems need not crop up only
                        in old age.
                    </li>

                    <li>If not any health issue, it could be hospitalisation due to an accident. Meeting medical
                        expenses which appear out-of-the-blue is not in the reach of everyone. At least not at present
                        times, when the cost of medical treatment is soaring high day by day.

                    </li>
                    <li>The product that covers the expenses that arise out of such emergencies is Health Health
                        Insurance.
                        Periodical payment of premium as stipulated by the Health Insurance Company has to be made. The
                        payment
                        of the premium could be either monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly.</li>
                    <li>The Health Insurance company either pays the medical expenses incurred directly to the hospital
                        or will
                        reimburse the expenses to the insured individual. Flexible coverage for ailments/disease is
                        provided. Some Health Health Insurance companies offer a cover for as many as 80 and above
                        surgical
                        procedures and as many as 30 and above critical illness.</li>
                    <li>Health Health Insurance can be a saviour when such critical emergencies emerge at the eleventh
                        hour. If
                        you have a huge family responsibility with regard to every member of the family, then going in
                        for Health Health Insurance for the entire family is recommended.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>With a Health Health Insurance Policy, you will be able to get medical treatment in the best of
                        hospitals without being worried about the cost of the treatment.</li> <br>
                    <li>Any medical emergencies can be handled with great ease even at times when you are in a
                        disastrous financial situation.</li><br>
                    <li>Imagine you come across a situation when you are diagnosed with a health issue which can be
                        treated in specialised hospitals whose cost of medical treatment seems unaffordable. This is at
                        such times that Health Health Insurance comes handy.</li><br>
                    <li>The cashless facility of the Health Health Insurance policy is the best feature. All the
                        expenses
                        incurred in the course of your medical treatment will be directly remitted to the hospital and
                        you will not have to worry about paying the hospital first and then claiming reimbursement from
                        the Health Insurance Company.</li><br>
                </ul>

            </div>

                <ul>
                    <h4>The main features of a Health Health Insurance policy are:</h4>
                    <li>Cover for expenses incurred prior to hospitalisation and post hospitalisation
                        The expenses incurred 30 to 60 days prior to hospitalisation and post hospitalisation will be
                        reimbursed upon submission of relevant bills and receipts.</li> <br>
                    <b>Treatment without payment - Cashless treatment:</b> <br>

                    Under this feature, treatment will be provided in the hospitals listed in the Health Insurance
                    policy
                    without the payment of cash. This relieves you of the burden of arranging for cash to meet the
                    expenses. The hospital authorities will send a pre-authorisation request with the details of
                    treatment and the cost. Pre-authorisation from the company will be as good as paying cash for the
                    treatment. The Health Insurance company will remit the treatment expenses directly to the
                    hospital.</b>

                    <li>Cover for life: Insurance provides a life cover to the insured to the extent of the sum assured.
                        This gives financial security for the family of the insured in case of any eventuality.</li>
                    <li>Steady investment: Life Insurance is an investment option that gives significant returns for the
                        premiums that are paid during the tenure of the policy. Some of the insurance plans give a
                        considerable return for your investment which will not only help you to fulfill your investment
                        goals, but will also keep your family financially secure in case of any eventuality</li>
                    <li>Income assured by way of annuities: Annuity plan could be the best retirement plan because you

                        the benefit of pension.</li>
